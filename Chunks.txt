The World class keeps track of all the chunks that are currently in use.
Chunks that have not been used for a while will be unloaded.

The engine asks for chunks that are near the player, so they can be draw. If there is no mesh it asks for one to be made.
If World has no record of the chunk then it will be generated (loaded from disk or freshly made).
